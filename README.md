Orthonormal Basis Function Generation and Error Probability Analysis
This MATLAB project aims to implement a code that generates orthonormal basis functions using the Gram-Schmidt procedure for a given set of input signals. Additionally, it provides functionality to analyze the error probability in the system practically using constellation diagrams.
